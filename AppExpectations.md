## App expectations ##
*We ask that each app meet the following requirements:*

- [ ] **Your app has multiple views**


Users will first be directed to a view where they can log in or sign up for an account, and are then directed to the MainActivity where they can use the bottom navigation menu to 
switch between a map view and a view of their profile information.
- [ ] **Your app interacts with a database (e.g. Parse)**

My app interacts with a Parse database in order to store user information as well as tags created by all users.
- [ ] **You can log in/log out of your app as a user**

Users can log in to their account through the log in page, and their session will be persisted across app restarts. Users can log out of their session by going to the profile view and clicking the Log Out button.
- [ ] **You can sign up with a new user profile**

Users can sign up with a new account on the log in page when they first open the app.
- [ ] **Somewhere in your app you can use the camera to take a picture and do something with the picture (e.g. take a photo and share it to a feed, or take a photo and set a user’s profile picture)**

Users can take a photo of the dog they are tagging when creating a tag to drop, as well as take a picture in the profile view to update/set their profile photo.
- [ ] **Your app integrates with a SDK (e.g. Google Maps SDK, Facebook SDK)**

My app integrates the Google Maps SDK so that users can intuitively visualize where each tag has been dropped.
- [ ] **Your app contains at least one more complex algorithm (talk over this with your manager)**
- [ ] **Your app uses gesture recognizers (e.g. double tap to like, e.g. pinch to scale)**
- [ ] **Your app use an animation (doesn’t have to be fancy) (e.g. fade in/out, e.g. animating a view growing and shrinking)**
- [ ] **Your app incorporates an external library to add visual polish**
